# Webpage Assets
This is where any assets for your webpage will be stored. This template only
has sample profile pictures to get you started. I reccomend swapping them out
for pictures of yourself ðŸ˜€. Crop your profile photos in a square aspect ratio
(e.g 1:1). If they aren't lining up properly then try adjusting the
`background-size` and `background-position` properties of the style section of
[index.html](../index.html)
