# Redirect Example
For some sites like YouTube you may not always be able to get a nice URL with
your username until you've met certain criteria. Also, not all platforms allow
you to post links so you may end up posting pictures of URLs instead. In cases
like these, you can use a redirect to make a URL that's easier for your
followers to read and remember. For example, an IG story with links like
http://yourgamertag.com/yt to send people to your YouTube channel or
http://yourgamertag.com/discord to send them to your Discord server will be much
easier to remember and type out.

## Creating Additional Redirects
This file provides an example for how to setup a redirect to a YouTube channel
but can be copied for whatever destination you would like. To create another
redirect, you'll just need to do the following:
1. Create another folder at the top level named for your redirect (e.g. discord)
2. Copy-paste this index.html file there
3. Update the destination link accordingly
